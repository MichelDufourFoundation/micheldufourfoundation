            <p>Michel Dufour is a fictional graphic designer whose face, works, life and ideas were completely invented by Artificial Intelligences. <a href='https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt' target='_blank'>ChatGPT</a> invented his life and his monograph “Graphisme”, of which it also wrote every text. <a href='https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2' target='_blank'>Dall-E</a> created each of his works, based on the descriptions given by ChatGPT. <a href='https://www.calligrapher.ai' target='_blank'>Calligrapher.ai</a> simulated his writing in his signature and in the letters between him and Paul Rand. The book was completely invented, conceptualized and wrote by ChatGPT from the following initial prompt: “Tell me the story of the greatest graphic designer no one has ever heard of.” This project was made by students Lorenzo Cicinato, Valentina Orfeo and Carlo Schlatter as a result of the workshop titled <i>A.I. — Blessing or curse for Graphic Design?</i>, held by Laurenz Brunner and curated by Jonathan Pierini at <a href='https://isiaurbino.net' target='_blank'>ISIA Urbino</a>, march 2023.<br>Michel Dufour is a fictional character.
